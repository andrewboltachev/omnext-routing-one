# omnext-routing-one
Routing example in Om Next using `set-query!` (Has one crazy hack in use. Needs improvement still)

## Features
* Query params example (pagination)
* Mutation example "Select random ocean"

## TODO:
* Routes with params like `/items/123` (maybe make use of https://github.com/gf3/secretary etc?)
* Turning into re-usable component
